Description: Fast and Frugal Trees (FFTs) are very simple decision trees for
    classifying cases (i.e.; breast cancer patients) into one of two classes (e.g.;
    no cancer vs. true cancer). FFTs can be preferable to more complex algorithms (such as
    logistic regression) because they are easy to communicate and implement, and are
    robust against noisy data. This package contains several functions that allow users
    to create, visualize, and test FFts from their input their own data.
