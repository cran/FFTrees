Description: Contains several functions that allow users
    to create, visualize, and test Fast and Frugal Trees (FFTs). FFts are very simple decision trees for
    classifying cases (i.e.; breast cancer patients) into one of two classes (e.g.;
    no cancer vs. true cancer) based on a small number of cues (e.g.; test results). FFTs can be preferable to more complex algorithms (such as
    logistic regression) because they are easy to communicate and implement, and are
    robust against noisy data.
