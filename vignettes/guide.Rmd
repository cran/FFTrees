<!-- Brief intro: -->

The R package **FFTrees** [@phillips2017FFTrees; @FFTrees-pkg] makes it easy to create, visualize, and evaluate fast-and-frugal decision trees\ (FFTs). 
FFTs are simple and transparent decision algorithms for solving binary classification problems in an\ effective and efficient fashion. 


## Fast-and-Frugal Trees (FFTs) 

<!-- Defining FFTs: -->

A _fast-and-frugal tree_ (FFT) [@martignon2003naive] is a set of hierarchical rules for solving binary classification tasks based on very little pieces of information (usually using\ 4 or fewer cues). 
In contrast to more complex decision trees, each node of an\ FFT has exactly two branches. 
A branch can either contain another cue (i.e., ask another question) or lead to an exit (i.e., yield a decision or prediction outcome).  
Each non-final node of an\ FFT has one exit branch and the final node has two exit branches. 

<!-- Characteristics and benefits of FFTs: -->

FFTs are simple and effective decision strategies that use minimal information for making decisions in binary classification problems [see @gigerenzer1999fast;@gigerenzer1999good]. 
FFTs are often preferable to more complex decision strategies (such as logistic regression, LR) because they rarely over-fit data [@gigerenzer2009homo] and are easy to interpret, implement, and communicate in real-world settings [@marewski2012heuristic]. 
FFTs have been designed to tackle many real world tasks from making fast decisions in emergency rooms [@green1997alters] to detecting depression [@jenny2013simple]. 

<!-- Emphasize transparency: -->

Whereas their performance and success are empirical questions, a key theoretical advantage of FFTs is their _transparency_ to decision makers and anyone aiming to understand and evaluate the details of an algorithm. 
In the words of @burton2020, "human users could interpret, justify, control, and interact with a fast-and-frugal decision aid" (p.\ 229). 


## Using the FFTrees package

The **FFTrees** package makes it easy to produce, display, and evaluate FFTs [@phillips2017FFTrees]. 
The package's main function is `FFTrees()` which takes formula\ `formula` and dataset\ `data` arguments and returns several FFTs that attempt to classify training cases into criterion classes. 
The FFTs created can then be used to predict new data to cross-validate their performance. 

Here is an example of using the main `FFTrees()` function to fit FFTs to `heart.train` data: 

```{r fft-example, message = FALSE, results = 'hide'}
# Create a fast-and-frugal tree (FFT) predicting heart disease:
heart.fft <- FFTrees(formula = diagnosis ~.,
                     data = heart.train,
                     data.test = heart.test,
                     main = "Heart Disease",
                     decision.labels = c("Healthy", "Diseased"))
```

The resulting `FFTrees` object `heart.fft` contains 7\ FFTs that were fitted to the `heart.test` data. 
To evaluate a tree's predictive performance, we compare its predictions for the un-trained `heart.test` data with their true criterion values. 
Here is how we can apply the best training FFT to the `heart.test` data: 

```{r fig-1, fig.width = 6.5, fig.height = 6.0, out.width = "600px", fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "A fast-and-frugal tree (FFT) to predict heart disease status."}
# Visualize predictive performance:
plot(heart.fft, data = "test")
```

## Getting started 

To start using the **FFTrees** package, we recommend studying the [Tutorial: Creating FFTs for heart disease](FFTrees_heart.html). 
The tutorial illustrates the basics steps of creating, visualizing, and evaluating fast-and-frugal trees (FFTs). 
The scientific background of FFTs and the development of **FFTrees** are described in @phillips2017FFTrees (doi\ [10.1017/S1930297500006239](`r url_JDM_doi`) | [html](`r url_JDM_html`) | [PDF](`r url_JDM_pdf`)). 
The following vignettes provide details on related topics and corresponding examples.

#### Details about the datasets {-}

When preparing data to be predicted by FFTs, we usually distinguish between several (categorical or numeric) predictors and a (binary) criterion variable. 
**Table\ 1** provides basic information on the datasets included in the **FFTrees** package (see their documentation for additional details).

baseline_values <- c(1, TRUE, "acc", TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, 
                     TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, "red")

# Use combined lists/vectors and apply describe_data() to each:

                      data_name = data_names, criterion_name = criterion_names, 
                      baseline_value = baseline_values, SIMPLIFY = FALSE)

# Combine results in df:
combined_result <- do.call(rbind, result_list)

# Round baseline and NA pct values for brevity:
combined_result$Baseline_pct<- round(combined_result$Baseline_pct, 1)
combined_result$NAs_pct<- round(combined_result$NAs_pct, 2)

# Rename columns:
colnames(combined_result) <- c("Dataset name", 
                               "Number of cases",
                               "Criterion name", 
                               "Baseline (`TRUE`,\\ in\\ %)",

                               "NAs (in\\ %)")

# Render the table from the data frame
# use as many items per page as we have data sets
# redefine column names as we like them:
