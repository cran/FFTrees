## Accuracy Statistics in **FFTrees** 

In this vignette, we cover how accuracy statistics are calculated for FFTs and the **FFTrees** package [as described in @phillips2017FFTrees]. 
Most of these measures are not specific to FFTs and can be used for any classification algorithm. 

First, let's look at the accuracy statistics from a heart disease FFT: 

```{r fft-example, out.width="80%", fig.align = "center", echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "**Figure 1**: Example FFT for the `heartdisease` data."}
# Create an FFTrees object predicting heart disease
heart.fft <- FFTrees(formula = diagnosis ~.,
                     data = heartdisease)

plot(heart.fft)
```

We notice a 2x2\ table in the bottom-left corner of the plot:  
This is a _2\ x\ 2 matrix_ or _confusion table_ (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion_matrix) or [Neth et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.567817) for details). 
A wide range of accuracy measures can be derived from this seemingly simple matrix. 
Here is a generic version of a confusion table: 

```{r confusion-table, fig.align = "center", out.width="50%", echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "**Figure 2**: A 2x2 matrix illustrating the frequency counts of 4 possible outcomes."}
knitr::include_graphics("../inst/confusiontable.jpg")
```

A 2\ x\ 2 matrix cross-tabulates the decisions of the algorithm (rows) with actual criterion values (columns) and contains counts of observations for all four resulting cells. 
Counts in cells\ a and\ d refer to correct decisions due to a match between predicted and criterion values, whereas counts in cells\ b and\ c refer to errors due to the mismatch between predicted and criterion values. 
Both correct decisions and errors come in two types: 

- Correct decisions in cell\ *hi* represent _hits_, positive criterion values correctly predicted to be positive, and cell\ *cr* represents _correct rejections_, negative criterion values correctly predicted to be negative. 

- As for errors, cell\ *fa* represents _false alarms_, negative criterion values erroneously predicted to be positive, and cell\ *mi* represents _misses_, positive criterion values erroneously predicted to be negative. 

Given this structure, an accurate decision algorithm aims to maximize the frequencies in cells\ *hi* and\ *cr* while minimizing those in cells\ *fa* and\ *mi*. 


| Output | Description                   | Formula | 
|:-------|:------------------------------|:----------------------|
| `hi`   |  Number of hits   | $N(\text{Decision} = 1 \land \text{Truth} = 1)$ |
| `mi`   |  Number of misses | $N(\text{Decision} = 0 \land \text{Truth} = 1)$ |
| `fa`   |  Number of false-alarms | $N(\text{Decision} = 1 \land \text{Truth} = 0)$ |
| `cr`   |  Number of correct rejections | $N(\text{Decision} = 0 \land \text{Truth} = 0)$ |
| `N`    |  Total number of cases| $N = \text{hi} + \text{mi} + \text{fa} + \text{cr}$ |

**Table 1**: Definitions of the frequency counts in a 2x2\ confusion table. The notation $N()$ means number of cases (or frequency counts). 


### Conditional accuracy statistics

The first set of accuracy statistics are based on subsets of the data. 
These subsets result from focusing on particular cases of interest and computing conditional probabilities based on them. 
Given the 2x2 structure of the confusion table, measures can be conditional on either algorithm decisions (positive predictive vs. negative predictive values) or criterion values (sensitivity vs. specificity). In other words, these measures are conditional probabilities that are based on either the rows or columns of the confusion table:


| Output | Description | Formula | 
|:------ |:------------------------------|:----------------------|
| `sens` | Sensitivity  | $p(\text{Decision} = 1 \ \vert\ \text{Truth} = 1) = hi / (hi + mi)$ |
| `spec` | Specificity  | $p(\text{Decision} = 0 \ \vert\ \text{Truth} = 0) = cr / (cr + fa)$ |
| `far`  | False alarm rate  | $1 - spec$ |
| `ppv`  | Positive predictive value  | $p(\text{Truth} = 1 \ \vert\ \text{Decision} = 1) = hi / (hi + fa)$ |
| `npv`  | Negative predictive value  | $p(\text{Truth} = 0 \ \vert\ \text{Decision} = 0) = cr / (cr + mi)$ |

**Table 2**: Conditional accuracy statistics based on either the rows or columns of a 2x2\ confusion table.


The _sensitivity_ (aka. _hit-rate_) is defined as $sens = hi/(hi + mi)$ and represents the percentage of cases with positive criterion values that were correctly predicted by the algorithm. 
Similarly, _specificity_ (aka. _correct rejection rate_, or the complement of the _false alarm rate_) is defined as $spec = cr/(fa + cr)$ and represents the percentage of cases with negative criterion values correctly predicted by the algorithm.

The _positive-predictive value_\ $ppv$ and _negative predictive value_\ $npv$ are the flip-sides of\ $sens$ and $spec$, as they are conditional accuracies based on decision outcomes (rather than on true criterion values). 


### Aggregate accuracy statistics

Additional accuracy statistics are based on all four cells in the confusion table: 

| Output | Description | Formula | 
|:------ |:------------------------------|:----------------------|
| `acc`  | Accuracy | $(\text{hi} + \text{cr}) / (\text{hi} + \text{mi} + \text{fa} + \text{cr})$ |
| `bacc` | Balanced accuracy  | $\text{sens} \times .5 + \text{spec} \times .5$ |
| `wacc` | Weighted accuracy  | $\text{sens} \times w + \text{spec} \times w$   |
| `bpv`  | Balanced predictive value  | $\text{ppv} \times .5 + \text{npv} \times .5$ |
| `dprime` | D-prime | $z_{\text{sens}} - z_{\text{far}}$ |

**Table 3**: Aggregate accuracy statistics based on all four cells of a 2x2\ confusion table.

Overall _accuracy_ (`acc`) is defined as the overall percentage of correct decisions ignoring the difference between hits and correct rejections. The more specific measures\ $bacc$ and\ $wacc$ are averages of sensitivity and specificity, while\ $bpv$ is an average of predictive values. The $dprime$ measure is the difference in standardized ($z$-score) transformed\ $sens$ and\ $far$ [see @luan2011signal for the relation between FFTs and signal detection theory, SDT]. 


### Speed and frugality statistics

The next two statistics measure the speed and frugality of a fast-and-frugal tree\ (FFT). 
Unlike the accuracy statistics above, they are _not_ based on the confusion table. 
Rather, they depend on how much information FFTs use to make their predictions or decisions.

| Output| Description | Formula | 
|:------|:-----------------------------------------|:----------------------|
| `mcu` | Mean cues used: Average number of cue values used in making classifications, averaged across all cases | |
| `pci` | Percentage of cues ignored: Percentage of cues ignored when classifying cases | $N(\text{cues in data}) - \text{mcu}$ |

**Table 4**: Measures to quantify the speed and frugality of FFTs. 

To see exactly where these statistics come from, let's look at the results for `heart.fft` (Tree \#1): 

```{r fft-heart}
heart.fft
```

According to this output, Tree \#1 has `mcu = 1.73` and `pci = 0.87`. 
We can easily calculate these measures directly from the `x$levelout` output of an `FFTrees` object. 
This object contains the tree level (i.e., node) at which each case was classified:

```{r fft-levelout}
# A vector of levels/nodes at which each case was classified:
heart.fft$trees$decisions$train$tree_1$levelout
```

Now, to calculate\ `mcu` (the _mean number of cues used_), we simply take the mean of this vector:

```{r fft-mcu}
# Calculate the mean number or cues used (mcu): 
mean(heart.fft$trees$decisions$train$tree_1$levelout)
```

Now that we know where\ `mcu` comes from, computing `pci` (i.e., the _percentage of cues ignored_) is just as simple --- it's just the total number of cues in the dataset minus\ `mcu`, divided by the total number of cues in the data: 

```{r fft-pci}
# Calculate pci (percentage of cues ignored) as 
# (n.cues - mcu) / n.cues):
n.cues <- ncol(heartdisease) 
(n.cues - heart.fft$trees$stats$train$mcu[1]) / n.cues
```

### Additional measures 

There is a wide range of additional measures that can be used to quantify classification performance. 
Most of these can easily be computed from the numerical information provided in an `FFTrees` object. 
For alternative measures based on the frequency counts of a 2x2\ matrix, see [Table 3](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.567817/full#h5) of @neth2021matrix.
